# 1.
# Please write a program which asks the user for a number. The program then prints out the number multiplied by five.

# The program should function as follows:

# Sample output
# Please type in a number: 3
# 3 times 5 is 15

# Hint: covert the input into a integer when prompting the user



# 2.
# This program asks the user for three numbers. The program then prints out their product, that is, the numbers multiplied by each other. 
# There is, however, something wrong with the program - it doesn't work quite right, as you can see if you run it. 
# Please fix it.

# An example of the expected execution of the program:

# Sample output
# Please type in the first number: 2
# Please type in the second number: 3
# Please type in the third number: 5
# The product is 30


# Fix the code
# number = int(input("Please type in the first number: "))
# number = int(input("Please type in the second number: "))
# number = int(input("Please type in the third number: "))

# product = number * number * number

# print("The product is", product)




# 3.
# Please write a program which asks the user for two numbers. The program will then print out the sum and the product of the two numbers.

# The program should function as follows:

# Sample output
# Number 1: 3
# Number 2: 7
# The sum of the numbers: 10
# The product of the numbers: 21
