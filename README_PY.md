# Introduction to Python üêç

## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** that is easy to learn and widely used across different fields ‚Äî from web development and data analysis to artificial intelligence and automation. It emphasizes **readability** and **simplicity**, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

## How Python Works

Unlike compiled languages (like C or Java), Python is **interpreted** ‚Äî meaning that the Python interpreter reads and executes your code **line by line**. This allows you to test ideas quickly without the need for manual compilation.

Here‚Äôs a simple example:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

When you run this code, Python immediately prints the message to the screen.

### Key Features
- **Easy to read and write** syntax  
- **Cross-platform** (works on Windows, macOS, and Linux)  
- **Extensive standard library** for common programming tasks  
- **Open source** and supported by a large community
