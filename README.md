# 🐍 Python Basics – Student Exercises

Welcome to the **Python Basics** exercises repository!  
This repository will guide you step by step through the core concepts of Python programming.  
Each `.py` file contains explanations, examples, and exercises.  
Please follow the order below - each file builds on the previous one.

## ⚠️ Important Note

We will **not** be using **GitHub Codespaces** in this course.  
Please **do not click “Set up Codespaces”**.  We will do that **before reaching the final file** – `f_strings.py`.

## 🧭 Learning Path

### 1️⃣ `app.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Write a program using  `print()` statements!


📘 **Learn more:** [W3Schools – Python Print Function](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_func_print.asp)

---

### 2️⃣ `aritmetic.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Learn how to perform **arithmetic operations** and print the results.

**Tip:**  
Notice that numbers and strings are treated differently - arithmetic operations don’t use quotes!

---

### 3️⃣ `minutes.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Write a program that calculates the **number of minutes in a year** using Python arithmetic.

**Tip:**  
Use multiplication (`*`) to calculate total minutes.  
Try modifying your program to calculate the minutes in a leap year too!

---

### 4️⃣ `input.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Learn to use the **`input()`** function to read user input.

**Tip:**  
Remember that `input()` always returns a **string**.  
If you need a number, convert it using `int()` or `float()`.

📘 **Learn more:** [W3Schools – Python User Input](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_user_input.asp)

---

### 5️⃣ `name.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Solve two exercises about user input and text output - collecting and printing names and addresses.

**Tip:**  
Use `\n` to print text on a new line, and `+` to combine (concatenate) strings.  
Before the **second exercise**, review the next file `variables.py`.

---

### 6️⃣ `variables.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Understand how **variables** work - how to store, replace, and use data in your program.

**Tip:**  
A variable stores data that can change as the program runs.  
Be careful: if you assign a new value to a variable, the previous one is lost.

---

### 7️⃣ `strings.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Work with **strings and concatenation**. You’ll fix a small bug and write a short interactive story!

**Tip:**  
Double-check your variable names and remember that each input should be stored in a **different variable**.  
Try using `+` to join text and variables, or commas in `print()` for easier formatting.

---

### 8️⃣ `more_aritmetics.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Practice arithmetic operations again - multiplying, summing, and fixing buggy code.

**Tip:**  
Use descriptive variable names (like `first_number`, `second_number`) and always convert inputs with `int()` before doing math.

---

### 9️⃣ `f_strings.py`
**What you’ll do:**  
Learn about **f-strings**, an elegant way to format your output.  
Then complete a final exercise where you’ll fix and improve a job application script.

**Tip:**  
Use curly braces `{}` inside f-strings to insert variable values directly into your text.  
Try adding `\n` for new lines and indentation for clean output.

## ✅ General Tips for Students

- Always **read the comments** in each file - they guide you step by step.  
- **Run and test your code frequently.** Change values and see what happens.  
- Don’t worry about mistakes - that’s how you learn programming!  
- If you’re unsure about something, **ask questions** - curiosity is key.
