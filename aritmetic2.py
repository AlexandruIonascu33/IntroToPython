# You can put arithmetic operations inside a print command. 
# Running it will then print out the result of the operation. 
# For example, the following program
print(2 + 5)
print(3 * 3)
print(2 + 2 * 10)

# Notice the lack of quotation marks around the arithmetic operations above. 
# Quotation marks are used to signify strings. 
# Strings aren't just words as we commonly understand them, but instead a single string can be as long as multiple complete sentences. 
# Strings are usually printed out exactly as they are written. Thus, the following two commands produce two quite different results:


# print(2 + 2 * 10)
# print("2 + 2 * 10")
